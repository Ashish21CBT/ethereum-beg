## Overview

My Token is a basic Ethereum token contract that demonstrates the concept of minting and burning tokens. The contract provides essential functions to manage the token's total supply and individual balances.

## Contract Details

- **Token Name:** Ashish Token
- **Token Abbreviation:** Ash
- **Total Supply:** 0

The contract uses the Solidity version 0.8.18 and is licensed under the MIT License.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the My Token contract, you can follow these steps:

1. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using a development environment like Remix or Truffle.
2. Interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets or applications that support ERC-20 tokens.

## Functions

The contract provides the following functions:

### `mint(address sender, uint value)`

Mints new tokens and increases the total supply. This function is used to add tokens to the balance of a specified address.

Parameters:
- `sender`: The address to which the tokens will be minted.
- `value`: The amount of tokens to mint.

### `burn(address sender, uint value)`

Burns tokens and decreases the total supply. This function is used to remove tokens from the balance of a specified address.

Parameters:
- `sender`: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
- `value`: The amount of tokens to burn.
